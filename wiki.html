                (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time portrayed by Edward
                Norton), and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. <small>With

                June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the
                film was pushed back for a 2012 release. <ins>Whedon was brought on board in
                April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn.</ins> Production
